<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>At Jane Street, we trade many different types of financial instruments. For this
competition, we will focus on a few of the basic types.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Stocks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>Many companies have securities that you can trade, "shares", which represent
ownership of a fraction of the company.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> ADRs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>Sometimes investors want to be able to buy and sell stocks of foreign companies on
US exchanges. This can be achieved by trading a receipt called an ADR (American
Depository Receipt), issued by a US bank. An ADR can be converted to the foreign stock
by bringing it to the issuer.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Currencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>Other financial instruments are bought and sold with currencies, such as US
Dollars (USD), British Pounds (GBP), or Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). Many
currencies can also be traded in terms of others, so for example trading USDHKD
lets you buy or sell US dollars using Hong Kong dollars. Some currencies trade
freely, while others have fixed relationships to each other.
</p>
<p>
Each unit of a currency pair you trade today is for 10000 of the base currency,
so if you buy 1 USDHKD, you will be receiving 10000 USD.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Orders</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>In the most basic sense, trading is buying and selling securities. There are
different kinds of orders that one might send to an exchange, the most common being
a limit order. A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell a security at a
particular price (the "limit").
</p>
<p>
The parameters that specify a limit order are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the security you want to trade
</li>
<li>Whether you want to buy or sell it
</li>
<li>The "worst" price you're willing to trade at (i.e. the highest price
  if you're buying, or the lowest price if you're selling).
</li>
<li>How many shares / contracts of the security you want to trade.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
A "bid" price is the price specified by a buy order, and an "offer" or "ask" price is
the price specified by a sell order.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Stock Exchanges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>A lot of our trading occurs on exchanges, which are highly regulated electronic
marketplaces that match up buyers and sellers in the following way:
</p>
<p>
Suppose you're the first person to send an order that day. You send an order to buy
10 BOND shares for $995. No-one is willing to trade against you right now, so the
exchange just enters your order into the "book" and it sits there. This is called
a "resting order".
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left">bids</td><td class="left">offers</td><td class="left"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">10</td><td class="left">$995</td><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Let's say someone else comes along and also sends a buy order for $995, for 100
shares. They can't trade with you &ndash; you both want to buy. So now the book
looks like this:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left">bids</td><td class="left">offers</td><td class="left"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">110</td><td class="left">$995</td><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Note that the exchange displays the sum of all of the orders at a given price
point and doesn't divide it up into the individual orders.
</p>
<p>
A few more people come in and send: a sell order for 500 shares at $1001, a sell
order for 50 shares at $1002, and a sell order for 3000 shares at $1005. There is
still no trading &ndash; the most anyone is willing to buy for is $995, but the least
anyone is willing to sell at is $1001.
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left">bids</td><td class="left">offers</td><td class="right"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">110</td><td class="left">$995</td><td class="left">$1001</td><td class="right">500</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td><td class="left">$1002</td><td class="right">50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td><td class="left">$1005</td><td class="right">3000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Finally, someone comes along and sends a sell order for 30 shares at a price of
$995. This can trade with the buy orders. Which orders get "filled"? First the 10-share
buy order gets fully filled, as it was on the exchange first (this is called
"price-time priority": the orders are sorted first by price, and then by age).
The owner of the buy order gets a message from the exchange telling them how many of their
shares traded (all 10 in this case). Now there are 20 shares left from the 30-share
sell order. Next, the 100-share buy order gets partially filled with the remaining 20 shares.
The owner of this buy order gets a message from the exchange as well, telling them 20 of their
shares traded. And of course, the owner of the sell order also gets a message (or possibly
multiple messages) about their fills.
</p>
<p>
After that's all done, the book looks like this:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="right" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left">bids</td><td class="left">offers</td><td class="right"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">80</td><td class="left">$995</td><td class="left">$1001</td><td class="right">500</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td><td class="left">$1002</td><td class="right">50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"></td><td class="left"></td><td class="left">$1005</td><td class="right">3000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Price improvement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p> Any given trade is always between an order that was previously on the
 book (the resting order), and one that comes in and never gets
 entered into the book.
</p>
<p>
 The price of a trade is always that of the <b>resting</b> order. For
 example, if there is a resting order to buy for 80, and someone sends
 an order to sell for 70, a trade goes up at the price of 80.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The business of market making</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>Market making is one way that firms participate on the financial markets. The
purpose of market making is to act as an intermediary for other people's trading.
For example, suppose Alice wants to buy some shares, and Bob wants to sell some.
It seems good for them to trade with each other, but if we require that they
meet at the exchange at the same time, this is not likely to be efficient. If
this were really how markets worked, you might be afraid to invest.  Who knows
whether you'd be lucky enough to find a buyer when it came to sell?
And if you did find a counterparty, how would you agree on a fair price?
</p>
<p>
Market makers are always willing to buy and always willing to sell. They have
some conception of how much a security is worth right now (its "fair value"),
but no long term interest in owning the security. Market makers are always willing
to buy at slightly below the fair value and sell at slightly above it.  You can
think of market making a bit like running a supermarket: you are simply the link
 between the sellers of goods (wholesale producers) and the buyers (shoppers).
You charge some premium on your wholesale purchase price in order to make a profit.
</p>
<p>
Unlike a supermarket however, a market maker can sell securities that they don't
currently own, called "short selling", and end up with a negative position
(number of the security they own). You should try to keep your position close
to 0 in order to limit your exposure to large price moves, on which you don't really
have a long-term opinion.
</p>
<p>
It's important to note that it's wrong to think of trading as strictly a
zero-sum game. In particular, there will be other participants in the <code>etc</code>
market beyond the bots you create. Some of these might act like "investors" --
people just wishing to buy (or sell) securities, who want to keep that position
for a long time, putting capital at risk in order to earn a return. They're not
very sensitive to the price, since they mostly just trust that the market has
the fair price for the security right now. So they're likely to buy or sell on
whatever market they see. Other participants are competing with you &ndash; they have
a rough idea of what they think the security is worth, and they'll try to buy below
that and sell above it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Some basic trading strategies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>The basic strategy is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have some idea of a fair value for each security
</li>
<li>Attempt to buy the security for less than fair, and sell it for more than fair.
</li>
</ul>



</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Fair values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">

<p>How might you come up with a fair value in the first place? Since markets (both
in the real world and in this competition) tend to be fairly efficient most of
the time, a good starting point is that fair value is probably between the best
bid and best offer; half-way between these ("mid") is usually a good starting
place for fair.
</p>
<p>
There are some classes of securities for which coming up with a better fair is
relatively straightfoward. For example, as mentioned above, you can convert an
ADR to its underlying security for a fee, so if you have an adr FOO and an
underlying stock BAR, and know the conversion rate between their currencies, it
should be fairly clear how to get the price for one in terms of anotehr.
</p>
<p>
For other securities, it is less obvious what you might do. In general,
predicting whether a stock will go up or down is hard, so it is unlikely you
will be able to make money by betting on a stock going up or down. That said,
it can still be possible to make money by providing liquidity in these stocks,
but we we will give no further hints in this section :)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Trading from your fair value</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">

<p>It may seem that all the trickery is in coming up with a fair, and indeed it is
possible to do some very complex things in that space. But it's also not
obvious how to trade around it. Let's look at some basic ideas.
</p>
<p>
If you think a financial security is worth exactly $100, it is impossible to
make money by sending buy or sell orders at exactly $100. Obviously, you'll
want to send buy orders below $100 and sell orders above $100. The difference
between the price of your order or fill and your fair value is called the edge.
More precisely:
</p>
<pre class="example">
 edge = dir_sign * (fair value - order price)
 where dir_sign = 1 for buying and -1 for selling
</pre>


<p>
The way to think about edge is that it is the profit you earn by completing
that trade.
</p>
<p>
So given a fair value, where should you send orders? Let's look at two ideas:
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Pennying</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">

<p>You want to earn the most edge you can. Pennying is the idea of looking at
the current best bid and offer, and sending orders the minimum amount "inside"
that. I.e. you send a buy order at [current best bid + 1] and/or a sell order at
[current best offer - 1].
</p>
<p>
This kind of strategy is an example of "providing liquidity". You place orders on the
book, and when price-insensitive investors come along to trade, they find your orders
 already sitting there, and trade against them.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-4"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Taking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">

<p>On rare occasions, you might believe that the fair value is outside the current
best bid and offer, in which case you might want to trade with the current
market. For example, if you think [fair value] &gt; [current best offer], you might
send a buy order at [current best offer] to trade with the offer.
</p>
<p>
This kind of strategy is often referred to as "taking liquidity".
</p>
<p>
WARNING: You generally need to have a good idea of fair value to make money by
taking liquidity! Remember markets are generally fairly efficient most of the time!
